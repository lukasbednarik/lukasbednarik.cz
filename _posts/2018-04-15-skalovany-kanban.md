Jak můžeme škálovat Kanban? Odpověď je překvapivě jednoduchá:
Aplikováním Kanbanu ve větším měřítku. Jakmile máme zavedený
kanban systém pro alespoň jednu službu, existují tři dimenze,
do nichž může náš kanban růst.

## Škálování do šířky




Width-wise growth Encompass a wider scope of the work items’
lifecycle by expanding the end-to-end workflow both up- and down-
stream (see Figure 15). For example, if the original service models
only the development team’s process, explore what happens before
the items enter development and after they exit as “done.” A wider
scope for the process reveals potentially more areas for effectively
improving the service to customers.

Height-wise growth Consider the hierarchy of items that make up
deliveries, each level potentially having differing flow characteris-
tics. For example, a “user story” is a small part of the functionality
of a software product “feature,” which is part of a software release.
Kanban may be used at each of these levels—with differing work-
flows and policies at each level. This dimension uses the “scale-free”
nature of Kanban: the same principles and general practices apply
whatever the size of the work item, even though the nature of work
at the different scales entails very different systems and policies
(Figure 16).

Four specific levels are often identified:
1. Personal For example, the use of Personal Kanban19 for an indi-
vidual or small team to foster efficient and effective working
2. Team Understanding the team’s work as a “service” and apply-
ing Kanban practices to create a predictable flow of value
3. Product or Service Delivery Product management requires the
effective coordination of options for enhancements and the flow
of customer-valued changes for competitive advantage. The work
items should be considerably larger than those at the team level,
and generally recognizable by a customer or user of a product,
but much smaller than typical projects.
4. Portfolio At this level, Kanban supports investment-level deci-
sions concerning which new and existing projects need greater
or less investment to deliver change. Portfolio management is not
a variant of project management with bigger projects, but a com-
pletely different discipline, more aligned with managing financial
portfolios. Balancing risk in the portfolio by considering differ-
ent time horizons for return on investment, and multiple options
to address different outcomes and market changes, contribute to
building more resilient, antifragile20 organizations.

## Škálování do hloubky

Depth-wise growth A deep implementation of Kanban needs
not only greater depth of understanding, but depth of penetration
through the full set of services required by the organization to deliver
value. Depth-wise growth connects multiple services at the same
level through the feedback loops (cadences) that balance the capacity
across the services. Figure 17 shows how items blocked in one ser-
vice may be dependent on other specialist services. A service might
provide a specific function (legal, IT, HR, or accounting services,
for example) or be aligned around the delivery of work that requires
widely differing skill sets within them (new product development
or film and television services, for example). The challenge in the
extended Kanban ecosystem is to achieve balance and flow across all
of the interdependent services.
