![Nexus framework]({{ site.url }}/assets/less-framework.jpeg)

- Similar to Nexus, LeSS focuses heavily on Scrum-of-Scrums - the gray part in the middle.
- There are two flavors of LeSS: LeSS (up to 8 teams of 8) and Less Huge (a few thousand people on one product)
- I think a lot of its value are the items around the center, which I'm not sure is actually part of the framework.
